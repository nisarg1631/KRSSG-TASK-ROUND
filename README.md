*Task1

1. Run gru.py
2. Run minions.py as many times as the number of minions you want
3. Run client.py and enter the array size followed by the array

*Task2

Part1:
Run the Elevator.cpp file. Enter the number of entries followed by the entries.

Part2:
First run the Elevator.cpp and then the Client.cpp
Input format- Enter as many entries as you want. As soon as you want the elevator to move ahead by one time frame enter any entry with 'E' in between instead of 'U' or 'D'. When the program recieves any such entry it will move ahead by one time frame. Basically all inputs until an input with 'E' in between (e.g., 3E4, 1E2, etc.) is encountered will be added to the elevator queue. 

*Task3

Directly run the rrt_star_connect file or make it using the rrt_star_connect.cpp and then run it. The my_turtle_rrt is the ROS source file for the 2nd and 3rd part of the task.

*Task4

Observation data and modified scripts of pendulum environment for different changes have been attached.
